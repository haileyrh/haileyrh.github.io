                                    Being a roller skater in a rural area stands in extreme contrast to the bright world of California-esque skaters we see on social media every day. But this often lonely endeavor has its advantages and positives.

                                  When a bunch of French roller skaters started the online challenge called Happy Tricks in 2016 its aim was to encourage roller derby players to conquer skateparks during the summer break. This year it has evolved into a Europe wide fun game. During August, beginner, intermediate and advanced roller skaters can compete, win prizes and above all: have fun and connect.

                                      Hannah Perez started roller skating in September of 2020 at 31 years old. Inspired by street skateboarding, she was drawn to the creativity of street skating early on.  This project was filmed from June through August 2022, filmed and edited by Hannah’s husband, Tony Perez.

                                    Kaci has been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis about three years ago. But burying her head in the sand was never an option. Instead, Kaci shows that even though one might get diagnosed with a chronic illness, it’s not the end. Here she gives a little insight how she dealt with the diagnosis.

                                     In times where many of us are so self-focused it is more than refreshing to meet people like Tamara Katzenberger. Today, on Friday 13th, she laces up her skates to travel 350 kilometers across Belgium to raise money for Sea Watch. The German NGO supports the rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean Sea, notably by commissioning rescue ships. Tamara sums up her motivation to roll for a greater cause as follows: “There cannot be two answers whether people in distress should be rescued or not.”

                                     Really…Packing tips! Meeting up with skaters around the world has become a part of our culture. How many couches have you slept on and how many trips have you made in the hunt for skatopia? We will have this again; some countries are freer to move around now and it doesn’t feel that far away to be able to hop on a flight to visit some pals and skate some sweet spots.
