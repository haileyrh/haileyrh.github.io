                    <h2>Light</h2>
                
                    <p>     When you first take home a plant, it is absolutely normal for the plant to lose a few leaves as it is gettin used to its new space. It will soon adjust, if the lighting is right. Remember that plants become acclimated to light levels, so it is best to make the change gradually when moving your plant from a dark spot to a sunny area.  </p>
                
                    <h3>Bright Light</h3>
			  
                <p>These plants thrive in full sun exposure, and are best for rooms with south-facing windows.</p>
                
					<p>    [Side-by-side images: aloe vera, cactus, ponytail palm.] </p>
                        <figcaption>Come in and pick out an Aloe Vera, Cactus, or Ponytail Palm for your space.</figcaption>
                
                <h3>Moderate Light</h3>
			  
                <p>These plants love a good partial shade, and do best in east- and west-facing windows.</p>
                
					<p>    [Side-by-side images: ficus, monstera, phildendron.] </p>
                        <figcaption>A beautiful Ficus, Monstera, or Phildendron would be best for your space.</figcaption>
                
                <h3>Low Light</h3>
			  
                <p>Plants that do well in low light will thrive by a north-facing window.</p>
                
					<p>    [Side-by-side images: snake plant, pothos, cast-iron plant.] </p>
                        <figcaption>Try out a Snake Plant, Pothos, or a Cast-Iron plant for your space.</figcaption>
                
                <h2>Water</h2>
                
                    <p>     When you first take home a plant, it is absolutely normal for the plant to lose a few leaves as it is gettin used to its new space. It will soon adjust, if the lighting is right. Remember that plants become acclimated to light levels, so it is best to make the change gradually when moving your plant from a dark spot to a sunny area.      </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don-t overwater. Only water your plant when the soil feels dry.</li>
                    <li>Water slowly, so your plant's roots have time to absprb.</li>
                    <li>Most plants thrive when watered about once or twice per week.</li>
                </ul>
